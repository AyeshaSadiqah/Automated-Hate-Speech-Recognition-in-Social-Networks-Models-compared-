# Automated-Hate-Speech-Recognition-in-Social-Networks-Models-compared

This project presents a comparative analysis of machine learning models for detecting hate speech in social media posts. It involves preprocessing textual data, converting it into numerical features, training various classifiers, and evaluating their performance. The goal is to identify which model performs best at classifying hate and non-hate content.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objectives

- Clean and preprocess social media text data
- Convert text to numerical features using TF-IDF
- Train and evaluate multiple ML classifiers
- Compare performance metrics across models
- Identify the most accurate and reliable classifier

## ðŸ§  Models Implemented

- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Naive Bayes Classifier  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
